The purpose of the presentation was to share some real world experience and anechdotes of using Test Driven Development and Design.
For a demonstration of what the workflow looks like writing tests first, please see the demonstration [here](https://youtu.be/cgOtv9jrpvc).

To run the unit tests you will need LUnit Unit Test Framework available [at VIPM](https://www.vipm.io/package/astemes_lib_lunit/).
